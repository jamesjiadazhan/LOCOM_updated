Description: The LOCOM package provides the locom function for testing differential abundance of individual taxa (or OTUs) that is based on the log ratio of relative abundances between each taxon and a reference taxon. It also provides a global test of whether there is any differential abundance in a microbiome community. The tests accommodate continuous and discrete (binary) traits of interest and allows adjustment of confounders.
